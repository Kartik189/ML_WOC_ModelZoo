Using Machine Learning to predict CO2 emissions from a Vehicle by using a dataset provided.
It involves using LinearRegression Algorithm to do so.
1. Uploading Data And Filtering it(Correcting DataTypes,Nan Values etc if present)
2. Normalizing our data
3. Distributing data into Training And Testing Set.
4. Training Our Model.
5. Using it to test/predict data.
6. Using variance score to test the efficiency of our model
